# **Hand Recognition with OpenCV & MediaPipe**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to track and visualize hand landmarks in real-time using a webcam. It detects hands, marks key points (landmarks), and draws connections between them for better visualization.

**Features**

* Real-time hand recognition using MediaPipe Hands

* Draws hand landmarks and connections on the video feed

* Uses OpenCV to process and display frames

* Simple and efficient implementation

**Requirements**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies: ```pip install opencv-python mediapipe```

**Usage**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run the script to start real-time hand tracking: ```python hand_recognition.py```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press **Esc** to exit the application.

**Preview**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The script will open a webcam feed and display detected hands with red landmarks and green connections.

**License**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is open-source and available for modification and use.
